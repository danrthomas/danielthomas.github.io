I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Columbia University. I am broadly interested in employing computational social science, social network analysis and causal inference from observational data to study questions in political development. My dissertation focuses on the dissolution, formation and reformation of social networks during and after conflict. I use data collected from fieldwork in Myanmar and Ukraine to determine how violence and displacement shape the social networks of internally displaced people. Outside of the dissertation, I have published several papers on electricity access in India with a team of scholars from [SAIS-ISEP] (https://sais-isep.org/), one of which is forthcoming in the *Journal of Development Economics*.

For this academic year, I am a [USIP Peace Scholar] (https://www.usip.org/grants-fellowships/jennings-randolph-peace-scholarship-dissertation-program/current-peace-scholars#Thomas). My research has been supported by several other organizations, including the International Growth Centre, Innovations for Poverty Action, the Ryoichi Sasakawa Young Leaders Fellowship Fund, and several institutions at Columbia University. I have also been a PhD research intern at [Facebook Core Data Science] (https://research.fb.com/teams/core-data-science).
