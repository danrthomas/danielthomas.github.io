**"A theory of targeted and indiscriminate state violence in networks"**

*Revise and Resubmit at Journal of Peace Research*

Theories explaining why states choose to use targeted or indiscriminate
violence against civilians hinge on the state's capacity to gain
information about whom to target and its ability to do enough damage to
prevent defection to the rebel's side. In contrast to these theories, I
show that the choice of technology depends on characteristics of the
community experiencing the violence, not the state employing it. This
paper argues that even when states can target certain civilians, they
may choose to employ indiscriminate violence due to characteristics of
civilians' social network structure. The state's optimal choice of strategy
of violence is driven by two factors: the density of civilians' social
networks and the correlation between citizens' motivation to leave a
network and citizens' influence on the behavior of other nodes in the
network. When density is low and the two are more correlated,
indiscriminate violence is more often preferred.
