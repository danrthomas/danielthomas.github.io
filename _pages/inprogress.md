**The effects of exposure to violence on social network composition and formation: Evidence from IDP camps in Myanmar**

Working Paper

How does the experience of violence affect the composition of civilian social networks during wartime? I argue that violence can have direct and indirect effects on social networks: it directly shapes networks through killing and displacing nodes in pre-existing networks. The direct effect should decrease the size of victims' networks. Indirectly, it shapes the incentives and the ability of victims to engage in the formation of new links. While trauma might reduce the ability of victims to form new links, incentives to insure themselves against future shocks could make them more social. I employ original survey data from IDP camps in Kachin State, Myanmar, an area of active civil conflict, to establish evidence for these effects. First, I show that social networks are valuable for camp members. I then show evidence that exposure to violence reduces IDPs' social ties, and that it works primarily through a direct effect: victims of violence are less likely to have links in their camp's overall social network, and in networks consisting only of people they knew before. However, violence has smaller effects on the formation of links with new social contacts, suggesting that victims of violence substitute new links for ones they lose during displacement. I then show that victims are more likely to list new ties in their network of close ties.

**A theory of targeted and indiscriminate state violence in networks**

Revise and Resubmit at *Journal of Peace Research*

Theories explaining why states choose to use targeted or indiscriminate
violence against civilians hinge on the state's capacity to gain
information about whom to target and its ability to do enough damage to
prevent defection to the rebel's side. In contrast to these theories, I
show that the choice of technology depends on characteristics of the
community experiencing the violence, not the state employing it. This
paper argues that even when states can target certain civilians, they
may choose to employ indiscriminate violence due to characteristics of
civilians' social network structure. The state's optimal choice of strategy
of violence is driven by two factors: the density of civilians' social
networks and the correlation between citizens' motivation to leave a
network and citizens' influence on the behavior of other nodes in the
network. When density is low and the two are more correlated,
indiscriminate violence is more often preferred.
